# BitMap POC

## What is?

A bitmap is a compact, indexable data structure that represents a set of boolean 
states using individual bits stored inside machine words, enabling constant-time 
bitwise operations and high memory efficiency.

Instead of storing [true, false, true, false] store like 1010
